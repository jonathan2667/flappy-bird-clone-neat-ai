# Flappy Bird Clone with NEAT AI 🐦🎮

This project is a Python-based Flappy Bird clone that utilizes the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm to train a computer to play the game. It's built using the Pygame library for game development and the NEAT Python library for implementing the NEAT algorithm.

## Features 🌟

- **Classic Flappy Bird Gameplay** 🎲: Navigate the bird through a series of pipes by jumping through the gaps.
- **AI Training** 🧠: Uses the NEAT algorithm to evolve a neural network that learns to play the game over time.
- **Scoring System** 📈: Keep track of how many pipes you've successfully navigated past.
- **Game Over and Restart** 🔄: The game displays a "Game Over" screen and automatically restarts after a brief pause.
